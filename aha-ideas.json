This allows the users to see every ticket logged under the company which is not a level of access they need.\n\n\nI have tried to use the Ticket Status overrides but setting this to 'Awaiting Approval' means that the tickets the approver is the contact for do not appear for them.\n\n\nThe 2 options are see every ticket ever or see only the awaiting approval tickets and there is no in between. There needs to be a way to have Visible tickets be set to Personal AND have the Ticket Status Override in effect.\n\n |"

These inconsistencies in data could lead to less end user portal engagement as they can't trust the information they are seeing if they see conflicting info.\n\nWe would love to be able to develop \"content tokens\" whereby we can build blocks of content that can then be easily repurposed in multiple locations but centrally managed/updated at the token level. That way the actual data only exists in one place, removing the likelihood of inconsistencies over time.\n\nSome examples of where this could be useful include:\n\n1. Articles and courses - we use the same HTML blocks of content in evergreen articles AND in user onboarding courses\n2. Ticket submission confirmations - we want a consistent HTML styled ticket submission confirmation message every time and don't want to have to remember to update it everywhere if we make a small change\n\nThis list above is not exhaustive. There are many other applications for content tokens (or a similar solution)\n\nAcknowledging and expanding on similar requests:\n\n1. https://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-1775\n2. https://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-980\n\n |"

        "plain_text_body": "ScalePad / Warranty Master obviously has a good bit of overlap in its functionality especially in the vCIO planner and is probably in some way a competitor. It does fit a niche in reconciling issues within RMMs and Documentation, and does a really good job of lifecycle management. I was thinking it would make sense for the planner items to be able to sync to the planner board from ScalePad to CloudRadial. This would unify another item to CloudRadial, instead of some reports taking them to their ScalePad portal to review those items.."

        "plain_text_body": "Short Version:\nWe'd like a very basic integration with Quickbooks Online that allows us to map a client in Cloud Radial to a customer in QBO (the same way we map clients to M365 and our PSA), and then sync invoices from QBO to the Account > Invoices tab in Cloud Radial.\n\nAt least two other people have suggested similar ideas in the Cloud Radial feature requests section, both got some traction but then fizzled out. I think there is broad support across the Cloud Radial user base, and this would be useful for users of all PSAs that use external book keeping platforms.\n\n\nhttps://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-1086  (https://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-1086) 6 votes\n\nhttps://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-965 17 votes\n\nhttps://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-713  (https://ideas.cloudradial.com/ideas/C-I-713) 8 votes\n\n\nLong Version:\n\nWe use Syncro for our PSA/RMM. Currently, if you want all of the places that Syncro injects a link to the \"customer portal\" to redirect to Cloud Radial (and not Syncro's customer portal), you set the option for \"Disable Customer Portal and redirect to URL (Leave blank to allow access)\" under client settings in Syncro.\n\nWhen you do this, and then a client attempts to view the invoices in Cloud Radial under Account > Invoices, Cloud Radial attempts to send the user to the Syncro Customer Portal, which then sends them back to Cloud Radial.\n\nAdditionally, Syncro's tax rate calculation is very manual. Our workflow is for Syncro to push the invoice to Quickbooks Online, and then QBO calculates and adds the tax correctly based on the client billing location. We then send the invoices from QBO.\n\nHaving Cloud Radial pull the invoices PDF Quickbooks Online instead of from Syncro would ensure that clients can both get to the PDF easily, and that the invoice they view is correct. If we were to just send the client to the Syncro portal for the invoice, the total would not be correct, and it would only create more confusion."

That way, we could pull an existing Planner item from one client or workspace and reuse it for another — adjusting as needed.\n\nThis would be especially useful for batch planning efforts (e.g. quarterly or annual Computer Refresh cycles), where most Planner items are nearly identical but vary slightly in device count or details.\n\nThe goal is to reduce repetitive work, improve consistency across clients, and make it easier for vCIOs to plan and communicate recurring projects with minimal rework."

They wonder why they are over licensed when they go and and see less users reported for a specific Microsoft license than are actually using it.\n\nI would like to add a feature request to still show the user on the list in the license they are using (Usage - Licenses) even though they are excluded from the users list (Usage - Users).\n\nThis will solve the confusion we are continuing to run into with clients during license audits.\n\nFor now we will not be excluding these users, and moving our source of truth for employee counts to another product to get around this issue."

        "plain_text_body": "It would be great if the ConnectBooster integration could be extended to optionally replace the Invoices screen in CloudRadial.\n\nSpecifically, when this hypothetical option was enabled, instead of adding an \"Open Payment Portal\" button at the top of the Invoices screen, the invoices screen itself would be overridden to be a iFramed, SSO-Signed-In window to the ConnectBooster portal.\n\n\nUse Case:\nCurrently, the CloudRadial Invoices screen can only pull invoices from one source. The ConnectBooster portal can, however, pull invoices from multiple sources.\n\nIn our case however, we have some invoices that exist in our PSA (Syncro) and then get synced to QuickBooks and some that exist in QuickBooks only. ConnectBooster sees both of these sources and conglomerates all of the invoices together showing a complete financial picture for the client. CloudRadial, however, can only show a partial financial picture for the client since it doesn't have access to all the sources of invoices for the client.\n\nGiving the option of overriding the Invoices screen in CloudRadial with the ConnectBooster portal would eliminate the confusion of \"why is this invoice here, but not there\" as there would only be one view available into the client's invoices."

        "plain_text_body": "We are using the ConnectWise integration but other integrations may well benefit from these as well.\n\n\nStatus & Priority Fields\n\nAutomatic wildcard searching for Status and Priority text fields is a must.\n\nAt present text has to be entered precisely for search to work for both these fields. For example one of our statuses is \"Completed (Awaiting Response)\" so to find tickets with this status you have to enter it exactly, whereas expected behaviour would be that a search simply for \"completed\" should bring this up.\n\nSame issue for Priority as well. Worth noting the Subject field already behaves this way.\n\nIt may also be possible/preferable to change these into drop-lists - imagine easiest would be to populate them based on all Statuses and Priorities that appear in the list of tickets visible to the user rather than interrogating the boards themselves for a list of all possible values.\n\n\nDate Pickers\n\nDate pickers are not overly intuitive - they default to a very old date as From Date and current date as To Date. If a customer wants to select a more recent From Date using the date picker, this takes a number of clicks.\n\nSuggest both From and To date should be blank by default. This also makes it quicker for users to type dates in as they don't first need to delete or highlight the pre-filled date values."

This forces partners to either manually update dates in the PSA or create duplicate planner cards. Many partners use Kaseya Quote Manager which doesn't have estimated close dates, making the current system incompatible.\n\nSolution: Allow quotes to be freely movable in the planner, initially display them in a \"Recommended\" section, and optionally sync any moves back to the PSA. This would enable dynamic project planning during client meetings without the current rigid date restrictions. |"

We work with a lot of customers who have offices in several countries. So knowing where that person is and therefore their time zone is so important.\n\nYou can of course manually change it in ConnectWise but that's very time consuming and not realistic to keep doing on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhat I would like is for the Office field to be synced from M365/Azure. This is then matched against the ConnectWise Manage site and the contact's site set accordingly.\n\nI don't think this would be much work given the existing contact sync integration.\n\nA guess the same could apply to Autotask although I'm not overly familiar with it.\n\nPete"

More commonly, there are some individual users who do not want these notices popping up.

Contact types could be \"Accounts Payable, Contracts, Service Coordinator, Decision Maker, Co-Managed Technician, etc. etc.\" We are going to start rolling out the requirements to use pin numbers for support over the phone and need to tag specific people who will be allowed to access privileged information about their account so they can be easily identified should our employee not recognize who they are.\n\nThis is also a great way to be transparent with the client in regards to who the assigned contacts are at their company. Our leadership team or book keeper will often get calls from client users they may not be familiar with (especially if newer employee) so it is nice to see at a glance who the key players are with a given client.\n\nUser groups could be used for this if they could be managed globally and we (and the client) have an easy way to see associated groups while looking up the user. These are labels we use across our client base so we wouldn't want to have to set them up manually/individually for each client.\n\nFor now we will have to use UDF fields in our PSA which gets tricky because we want to be able to assign multiple roles to a single employee. A UDF with drop down values is good for automation/consistency however you can't easily assign two values in a drop down. (With our PSA) We will have to go with a clunky method of using multiple UDF's with drop downs."

        "plain_text_body": "It would be useful if in one of the reports/downloads (compliance policy or endpoint) if there was a way to have additional columns showing which areas failed the Windows 11 Readiness check.\n\nIf I have a client with 80 endpoints in need of replacing because they failed the Windows 11 Readiness check, that's a lot of wasted time to look into the \"why\" for each one, when the information has already been gathered by the Data Agent. It's an entirely different conversation with the client if it fails due to a lack of RAM, then that's a much easier sale vs having to sell them an entirely new machine.\n\nAs the report stands today, I can't just pull the report and blindly ask the customer to replace all the not ready machines. I'm forced to touch each one and update it. I know when this was initially released it was to \"start the conversation\" but we should be really looking to \"further the conversation\" at this point.\n\nI've attached a screenshot as an example of what I'm looking for."

I'm also fairly doubtful that you can edit the reporting to include the City field but I can verify that for you if you can point me to the exact report / report type you're trying to change. I think both these ideas would be good feature requests though and I can walk you through how to submit one. Regards,Tevin W."

Even the free UptimeRobot plans support API keys, including read-only API keys, which would be great to leverage for executive reports.\n\nI can very easily imagine a dashboard within CloudRadial that includes website and email server response times, backup success/failures, or anything else that we can task UptimeRobot to monitor, and then securely display within CloudRadial.\n\nAllowing us to 'outsource' the monitoring aspect to a service that excels at that, but then bring that data into a system that excels at securely sharing information with customers (CloudRadial) seems like a win-win for all parties."

But with others we have to leave the ticket mostly uncategorized because the answers would determine the categories.\n\nIt would be great to have the ability to map a PSA token to answers in the ticket form. For example, a ticket where a user can't access files or data asks where the files are located:\n\n* On my computer (Type=Computer, Subtype=Files, etc.)\n* On a network drive (Type=Server, Subtype=File Server, etc.)\n* In the cloud (Type=Service, Subtype=File Sync, etc.)\n\nMaybe this is too complex. But if developed, enables us to set the categories once from the ticket and that's less work for a technician to always have to change it on the other end. We could create separate tickets for each of these scenarios but that seems like overkill."

        "plain_text_body": "Maybe this is out of the realm of CR's goals but since you're already so nicely showing us information like mailbox size vs. quota for O365, what about setting up a configurable alert that can create a ticket in our PSA for when a mailbox is almost full? Had a few of these recently and it shouldn't be the customer coming to us saying their mailbox is already full.\n\nI know that we can probably, in every O365 tenant, create email alerts for this. What a pain. But if we can centrally in CR create an alert like, \"If mailbox is at 95% of quota OR 1GB free\" and have that push a ticket to the PSA that'd be really cool. This could extend to other kinds of O365 alerts eventually..."

        "plain_text_body": "It would be great if we could build an approval process for notifications for tickets that are submitted outside of the portal or that end up needing approval after the ticket was initially opened. We can do some of the notifications within our PSA (such as send an email notification to primary company contact), but it is limited. I love the idea of using an approval workflow for tickets that are changed to \"approval required\" status on who is notified from the portal itself. Similar to the approval capabilities from the ticket templates inside of CloudRadial. Some of our clients have very specific requests on who gets approval notifications and being able to route to Teams or email or slack would be great."

Provide a way to supply login and/or community credentials, a method to submit a series of device commands or an SNMP query that returns a result, and then compare the result with the user-defined policy parameter to determine compliance. Obviously this would have to proxy through an agent installed on the client infrastructure.\n\nAlternatively (and my recommended approach), allow the use of the integrated RMM tool to feed data to a policy as the RMM tools already have the aforementioned functionality. This could occur through API calls to Automate, or easier yet, a simple email sent from Automate to CloudRadial with specific content that CloudRadial can tie back to a policy and identify whether it's compliant.\n\nBottom line, the compliance feature in cloudradial is a great start but missing too many needed policy's for it to be the 'one stop compliance shop'."

Many clients DO NOT use the portal, and will not look up CSTAT on their own but an email would present this information.\n2. HTML widget to use publicly that posts the current CSTAT statistics for the past 7, 30, 90 days.\n\na. Two additional Boolean columns added in CSTAT - the first visible to the 'user' when they provide feed back, a check box that says 'allowed to share this feedback publicly'.\nb. The second additional Boolean field is 'display publicly' is controlled by the partner, this lets us filter what comments appear publicly and to be able to redact some if required (shares confidential information, negative in nature, not appropriate). However this public feed back Boolean does NOT impact the statistics, they remain true only the comments are limited."

The mean time to resolution\n4. Tickets by source (portal, phone, etc...)\n5. Tickets by status (in progress, resolved, etc...)\n6. Tickets by priority\n7. Tickets by created day\n8.

I'm thinking something like a single bar (chart) across the top of the Planner page.

Thank you.\n\nHey Brian, I can check on this for you! Regards, Jeremy Myers\n\nHey Brain, Sorry for the delay on this. I am going to discuss this with our developers, but I think this will need to be a feature request. Let me get with our team and see if it's something we can accomplish, and what path we need to take to get it done.  Regards, Jeremy Myers\n\nHi Brian, This will have to be a feature request for us, as it is something new for us. I will create this for you.  I would also suggest another method of updating these names that may be easier. You can run a PowerShell command against your current user list and update the users without first names that way. Example below # Connect to Office 365 PowerShellConnect-MsolService# Get all Office 365 users with blank first name$users = Get-MsolUser -All | Where-Object { [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($_.FirstName) }# Loop through the users and update their first nameforeach ($user in $users) { $user.DisplayName = $user.LastName # Set the display name to the last name $user.FirstName = $user.LastName # Set the first name to the last name Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $user.UserPrincipalName -DisplayName $user.DisplayName -FirstName $user.FirstName} I haven't tested this, but it should work with a little adjusting. In the above script we get all users, and then filter by any that have null for a first name. Then we use a loop to add the last names to first names. And a heads up, we cannot support scripting in general, only make suggestions. Regards, Jeremy Myers"

Basically there are lots of contacts in Manage that we never want to show up in CR, but if we want any sort of sync with the PSA, they all need to sync, then we need to manually exclude them, which is a huge pain."

For Service Requests and Tickets opened in the portal, is there a way for CR to update the summarized info in the email confirmation and also in the submitted ticket log? The longer the form and more info needed the harder to digest when reviewing later. For example, an idea to improve it might mean the info is presented in a grid/columned view rather than just listed with no parsing. Attaching examples of how the info is presented currently in the confirmation email and portal and is hard to digest. Thanks!"

Again, useful when sending a link in a ticket (i.e. Please fill out this form to request a laptop quote).\n\nIf there was a default token then I could create a question template for forms, at least, that had that token that would help.\n\nAlternately, if the permalink URL/icon was made visible in every KB article and ticket form by default that'd save me a lot more work."

Would love the ability to link these with a 1:1 relationship so that we can bring existing articles in Cloudradial into Autotask and vice versa. Autotask PSA will be a source of truth for us with a lot of our documentation but when we want to make it client facing we have to duplicate it in Cloudradial causing an unsynced copy to exist. Would love the ability to tell Cloudradial to import an existing document and maintain linking with it should it be updated in the future."

We do this because many clients have the same task, easier to update the global token.\n\n2) Create the client token that refrenences the global token (Ie, @Client-NewHire-AddtoAddressBookonMFP and its value is @NewHire-AddToAddressBookonMFP);\n\n\nThis worked well, clients that have the tasks, shows up.\n\nHowever, clients, that don't have the task, now have a task that shows up as @NotTheSameClient-AddtoAddressBookonMFP). My Boss man, does not want any cross client contamination, as we support local competitors, which may not like that their IT is supporting their competitor.\n\n\nTo fix this, we've had to create a global task for each client specific task, and then point it to another global task that is like N/a or Intentionally left blank.\n\nThis is causing 2 scaling issues.\n\n1) This creates tons of N/a or Intentionally left blank tasks, this can cause issues with techs doing the tasks accidently clicking to many times and removing legit tasks.\n\n2) We now have to create tokens eveywhere and is just not scalable.\n\n\n\nWe've been told to create new service templates for like clients, but our problem is still scalability for if our process changes, knowing what client is where.\n\n\n\nEasy fix, make checklist tokens work like security questions (or just tokens in general for that).\n\nEasy to know if the task list starts with an @, its a token, and if there isn't a client level token or global token, skip the task....\n\n\n\nmake it work please, your killing us."

        "plain_text_body": "Backup Radar (https://www.backupradar.com/) is a product somewhat similar to CloudRadial in vein that it is a framework to show an comprehensive set of data from differing products and varying data sources. As an MSP we obviously manage many backup systems in many scenarios (on premise, datcenter, cloud, etc...).\n\n\nThe only backup visibility (that I'm aware of today) in CloudRadial is limited to create a compliance repository that can contain backup reports. It would be ideal to display this under the infrastructure navigation menu item and to have a dashboard related to backups.\n\n\nTherefore, I recommend CloudRadial integrate with Backup Radar to add backup visibility into the portal. Backup Radar already has integrations but none in the same category of CloudRadial: https://www.backupradar.com/integrations"

If there was a way to give these tokens a null value that would then NOT show up at all instead at the moment the show up as the text of the token itself. This can make the tasks filled with useless check items.

It could change, add, or even remove Question Templates, (and other content?), without having to create company @Tokens for each client.\n\nExamples:\n\nOnboarding forms could automatically include a Question Template for Microsoft 365 customers ← Assigned the QT to token @365Questions, which is a member of the Company Group \"365 Customers\".\n\nMultiple forms for Provisioning, Removing, and Change Requests for Telephone Systems could make the correct Question Templates visible by simply adding @3CXProvision, @AvayaProvision, @3CXChange, etc. to the appropriate forms. The resulting Service Requests would include question templates for every supported system, and the one the company is grouped with will appear."

        "plain_text_body": "Because We are creating quite long Dynamic forms. For example , lets say the question is Is it just you that cannot send or recieve email or all users ? If they click All Users then we want this ticket as a P1. More importantly we can use the forms to gather the informations that help us decide the priroty. So in a ideal world we could reduce triage errors. Dynamic forms are clearer and more intuative than a endless list of forms. The downside is that there are not enough fuctions within the questions. One this we thought was to use a Prority question then hide it, but again the PSA status questions do not allow a default answer. This is that same for all the PSA questions. This prevents setting types also within a Dynamic form.\n\nI should also have added, the inability to hide template questions also provides a challenge for Dynamic forms."

        "plain_text_body": "I imagine this one will be a messier thing to try to implement, but this client mentioned that they actually do make an effort to look into prior ticket history to see if they can find a prior submission that they're seeing reoccur and wondered if there was a way to submit a new request while referencing the old one.\n\nI told them reopening the old request isn't ideal since the dates would be out of wack and that the new ticket would likely involve new trouble shooting that should be kept separate, but that I did appreciate and like that they wanted to reference the prior situation.\n\nI don't have a clear vision for how something like this would work, but perhaps there could be a button/option somewhere when referencing an existing ticket that created a new ticket that did something to the effect of generating a new ticket that prefilled the description with something about the referential nature and giving the user a text box to explain current status?\n\nSomething like this:\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSubject: Printing Problems | [Contact Name]\nDescription:\n\"Client has referenced [Ticket Number] and believes this new submission is a recurrence of troubleshooting/issues resolved in that ticket. New information provided by client follows:\n\n[Insert whatever they typed out here]\"\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nMaybe it'd be important to get them to redo the submission via whatever the prior Service Workflow or Request Support they used on the initial ticket, but those are going to likely be customized content packages and I doubt that callback would be easy to do...\n\nStill, I think it'd be valuable to present the client with the ability to make that association in some method so that it rewards their being invested in and familiar with the support history they have with their MSP.\n\nLike I said, I know this one isn't as clean cut as the other submissions I've made; just let me know if this is even something you're interested in exploring so that I can pass that along to the client and establish some other method with them to do that referencing.\n\n\nThanks!!!"

        "plain_text_body": "It would be Incredibly helpful to somehow be able to route tickets to Custom PSA fields. In my organization we are split up into teams and we use a Custom Connectwise field to sort clients into their own teams (Alpha, Bravo, Delta, etc.).\n\nI see that the system might have the capabilities to handle something like that but either not all the pieces are there or I just cant puzzle my way into how to handle it. Cloudradial is able to take information and store that a custom field and is able to automatically route tickets to tokens and it just feels like it's so close with both of those.\n\nFrom my own testing here are the two ways I can picture that working but the capability to handle it properly is just not quite there.\n\n1. Given that we can store in custom fields using questions in content, if we had the ability to create say a hidden question that is just just accepts a token and stores it without a customer knowing that could help with the routing.\n\nMy thought in testing was to create a Company Level Token for all clients called @SupportTeam, and each of those individual tokens points to a respective global token pool. So some @SupportTeam point to @AlphaTeam and others point to @BravoTeam. Just at a company-by-company basis. The hidden question would then take that answer given to it via @SupportTeam and store it in the custom field. But it doesn't look like there is a way to add a question to a ticket that is always invisible.\n\n2. This one is a bit simpler, if I we just had the ability somehow to set a Custom routing action to a custom field at the client level to handle all tickets for a company. So when setting up a company, having an option we can enable for custom routing, or append this information to all tickets, and then fill out the custom field I want appended and the value. So in my companies case I would give the system the custom field from our Connectwise \"Support Team\" and in the next field give it the value. So either \"Alpha Team\" or even a token I have already created @AlphaTeam.\n\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking and there is a way to do this already, but in my own testing I cant figure anything out to get this to work."

This is a very tedious process especially considering there does not appear to be a way to pull a listing of all CloudRadial client IDs.\n\nIdeally, there would be some sort of private API I could access which could download all of those values into a table of some sort, then from there I could perform a cross comparison against our RMM's database in order to check if whether or not the CloudRadial ID is missing, and would also make it very easy to automate the insertion of said ID value into RMM.\n\n\nBut further to that, it would be nice if we could go by client IDs from our own RMM, as opposed to having to use CloudRadial's IDs. Either way, this could easily be automated and save a lot of administrators quite a bit of time. Thank you."

This means we are only using subcategory questions under a single main category. Our clients love this. The problem is we had to create UDF's in PSA to track this information, then we have to manually assign the subissue each time. Would be nice to have a question's pre-defined answer that someone picks be able to be the subissue for the ticket so we don't have to manually pick it.\n\nAs part of this change we would also like to request that the main category for problems can be set to \"auto expand\" so our clients don't have to click to expand each time - or better yet - not have to even use a main category so they just show up without being under a main category.\n\nThe screenshot of Autotask shows the UDF that we display in the ticket so that the engineer knows what subissue to pick since it doesn't come over automatically."

This enhancement would enable the system to automatically trigger specific actions or notifications whenever a new ticket is created on our incidents board.\n\nThe ability to configure webhooks based on different criteria, such as service teams or ticket type, will allow for more tailored and effective incident handling.\n\nUse Case Scenario:\n\nIn our current setup, we use Zapier to notify our team on Incident tickets. However, we lack the ability to automatically segregate tickets to specific service teams based on predefined criteria. With this new feature, our system could automatically assign tickets to the appropriate team, notify stakeholders, and initiate predefined protocols, thereby optimizing our incident response process."

There will need to be 2 questions 2s, one for answer A and one for answer B, which leads to even more duplicate questions if there are more 'Hide Untils' built off of question 2. Similarly allowing a question to only show if Question 1 is answered A and Question 2 is answered B, would again reduce a lot of duplicate questions having to be created as a work around."

I feel an email notification is more generic, and it will work even if the PSA is not tied in.\n\n\nNotification address could be specified per customer (unset = no email sent).\n\n\nI envision this event to only fire once when a sync is performed where new breaches are found in order limit the amount of 'noise' that might get produced.

This means when the email is sent to the admins, they will see an email address in the subject line. From that, they will know if the request is aimed at them or not.\n\n\nThis solution is workable, but it doesn't present very well to the admin, and when it gets parsed to the ticket, our techs will see an email in the subject heading which will be confusing."

The products could live under the \"Options\" heading for example.\n\nThat being said, creating products one at a time can be brutal especially if you wanted to load in your entire service catalogue. Therefore, having the ability to bulk import products would be ideal.\n\nAn example of how this could be accomplished is like the way assessments can be imported via a templatized spreadsheet"

        "plain_text_body": "Add more data columns to the Advisories section to make it easier to quickly see what the advisory (i.e., failed ticket submission) is about.\n\nSo due to the lack of a look-up field for things like board statuses (CR does not look up the actual status, you have to manually type it in) after changing a board status in the PSA a bunch of tickets failed over a few days before I heard of it and found them manually in the Advisories section (no notice otherwise).\n\nNow going through each of them and trying to determine if I need to manually create a ticket for them (please implement a \"resubmit\" function, already requested in 2020). But being that they all look the same in the Advisories section I have no way of telling which one I was just looking at and which one I need to look at next. There's a ton of room to add another column that shows at least the \"Submitted by\" person name or even the time."

        "plain_text_body": "The .pkg is neither signed or notarized. I understand the choices made here are to use a script to inject configuration and install the pkg. However, there is no reason at all to not sign the package as it's a vanilla pkg without any customization for specific clients. Meaning it's sign once.\n\nThe Apple Silicon package installs arm64 binaries, but the package itself is created incorrectly and requires x86_64/Rosetta2 to be installed. For installations that are purposefully avoiding Rosetta2, this requires repackaging the agent to simply be able to deploy it.\n\nThe pkg installs binaries into \"/Library/LaunchDaemons/cloudradial.mac.agent/\". Installing binaries into \"/Library/LaunchDaemons/\" is akin to installing your Windows Agent in \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp\". Or \"/etc/systemd/system/\" in linux. In the 18 yers since Apple adopted launchd, I've never seen or ever imaged binaries would be purposefully installed in \"/Library/LaunchDaemons/\". \"/Library/Application Support/cloudradial.mac.agent/\" is likely the most appropriate place for the binaries. \"/opt/cloudradial.mac.agent/\" would also work well. \"/usr/local/cloudradial.mac.agent/\" is another appropriate place for the binaries. I run a rather liberal software stack in production and the only launchd plists are installed in the \"LaunchDaemons\" folder. Could someone possible speak directly to why this decision was made?\n\nNone of the binaries distributed in the package are signed or notarized. The bar for a minimum viable product on macOS needs to include signing (and notarization). Before macOS 13 unsigned binaries might not have been readily exposed to end users. However with the implementation of the \"Login Items\" macOS clearly and loudly announces any LaunchDaemon or LaunchAgent that is added to the system. Explaining why I'm deploying an unsigned agent to end clients is not something I should be doing while positioning myself as their trust IT/Security advisor. Regardless of the fact that unsigned LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents are announced to the end user signing and notarizing macOS binaries is simply good practice for all macOS developers.\n\nThe primary .Net binary is named \"CloudRadial.Mac.Agent\". Of all of my concerns this is probably the most easily given a pass, but I don't think it's completely trivial. By naming the binary with a \".Agent\" file extension, the Finder and apps treat the binary as a file and not an executable binary. For example attempting to inspect the file with Apparency.app: \"CloudRadial.Mac.Agent\" vs \"CloudRadialMacAgent\". You can see in the screen shots that \"CloudRadial.Mac.Agent\" presents as a generic file in the Finder and \"CloudRadialMacAgent\" presents as a generic executable binary. While there's no guile involved, with a cursory glance it looks like an obfuscation of the file type. It's a visual issue that also presents in System Settings \"Login Items\".\n\nAs an aside, why name the binary \"CloudRadial.Mac.Agent\"? The Windows application is \"CloudRadial.Agent.exe\" installed in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\CloudRadial Agent\". I don't think the macOS binary is mistaken for the Windows executable, so why not name the macOS binary \"CloudRadialAgent\"?"

        "plain_text_body": "Good morning. Just wondering if there is a better way of assigning licenses to users in CR than clicking into the user, click edit, click the license tab, drag and drop the license to the left column, then click submit.\n\nThis is proving to be a terribly long process. What's more is the interface seems to respond more and more slowly as it's used, no matter what browser is used. So if I need to update 50 licenses for an org it can literally take me 45 minutes just to get them all assigned. I don't seem to be able to click the license in the license section and then just select all the users to associate, and conversely I can't select a bunch of users and assign/unassign licenses to them in bulk.\n\nIs there another way, such as an import function?"

Therefore when our Triage Team adds the appropriate agreement to the ticket, it defaults back to a P3, even if they had originally set it as a P1 or P2.

Forcing the built in editor instead of uploaded .PDF articles that are far more professional looking feels like a massive limitation with this platform. Many times, these .PDF documents are NOT something I want shared via a public URL so that option is off limits as well since we can be talking about Cybersecurity policies that we need to publish to all of our customers. I would think this feature would be a good thing as publishing a .PDF once would save tons of disk space versus publishing separate ones in each of our customer's KB areas separately."

Schedule here:\nhttp://radials.io/David15\n\nAs an example is that CR updates the contact record (Pin and 365 sync).

If so, then making her role as Financial User should fix this.\n\nThanks,\nDavid K\nNeed a quick support call? Schedule here:\nhttp://radials.io/David15\n\n\n\nHi David,\n\nThat finance role does solve the error we were getting and allows the user into ConnectBooster, the problem with that is this allows the customer to access the Invoice tab in CloudRadial which we do not want\nto allow. The invoices that are listed (pulled from PSA) are not accurate. Jeff allowed us to use the @PaymentPortal token URL which avoided the need to allow rights to the Invoice tab in CloudRadial.

        "plain_text_body": "Right now, the way the \"Hide Until\" works is by checking for an exact value. It would be nice to have the logic for \"Any value\" or \"Not Empty\" or something like that. For us, we would like to use the \"checkbox\" option as a confirmation that information filled out above is accurate, but we only want it to appear once the client has actually filed the information in. For example, we have a Service Request package for Admins to inform us of new users that need onboarding, and we often run into issue when the client has misspelled the users name, which in turn causes us to create the Office 365 profiles and other accounts with incorrect spellings. Our goal is to hold our clients accountable with a confirmation checkmark that they are providing accurate information."

        "plain_text_body": "I love the charts throughout CR. For viewing existing tickets, there can be a lot of open tickets for larger (or onboarding) customers. I'm looking for better ways in which they can visualize tickets.\n\nCould you add new charts that show things like ticket freshness? Also a view showing where we're waiting for customer response would be great. I realize we'd have to specify the status that populates this chart as it's specific to an MSP.\n\nThis way when a site admin sees these views they have more perspective. If 40 out of 60 tickets are sitting waiting for users to respond that's a whole different thing than a site admin seeing 60 open tickets, no idea as to why there are that many still open."

        "plain_text_body": "The most frequent question I get involving software on a computer is \"How many copies are we using right now?\" and that's almost always followed up with \"Can we move a copy from a computer to save us from spending money?\"\n\nThe list of applications on a computer is nice to have, but is impractical in its current form due to almost always being 15-20 pages long and filled with countless frameworks, driver packages, and other applications that frankly intimidate the client when they look at it.\n\nIt would be helpful to be able to tag applications so that we can filter or report on the number of endpoints reporting an application tagged with <#tag>.\n\nI spent about 20 minutes today helping a customer try to corelate how many seats of each version of a particular piece of software they currently had deployed and on which computers so we could determine how many more they needed to buy and how many needed to be upgraded. A tagging system like that I'm suggesting uses components and data CloudRadial already has and just expands their use.\n\nQuick examples being the application \"AutoCAD 2018 - English\" getting tagged as \"AutoCAD\" \"AutoCAD 2018\" and \"AutoDesk\" vs \"Revit 2020\" getting tagged \"Revit\" \"Revit 2020\" and \"AutoDesk\" gives me the groundwork to easily build a meaningful dashboard for a customer to be able to see what they own and where it is. Something like this would have allowed me to give them live access to that information to the point that I wouldn't have even needed to be involved.\n\nI have also been wanting a way to help teach my customers how to recognize a 'healthy' machine, and I occasionally get \"what's this?\" questions where being able to tag applications as something that we require or are otherwise responsible for would further help foster peace of mind."

Heck, I couldn't even find it...haha Therefore, I see 3 recommendations here:\n\n1. Give the assessor an obvious link and button the next time they log into CloudRadial: When a user is assigned to fill out an assessment it would be good to have an alert pop up in the notification column of the users home screen in bright colors (like the current alerts) stating something like \"you've been assigned a NIST assessment by Ricky\" and then have a button labeled \"take assessment\" that would take you directly to the screen were you can begin answering the questions.\n2. Put a \"pickup where you left off\" notification in the alert column of the user home screen so they can easily go back to filling out that super exciting assessment that will take them 2 hours :)\n3. I did not see the ability to do this so if I missed this please ignore - But once an assessment is assigned to a user it would be helpful if they've receive an email alert with the details of what the assessment is about, who assigned it to them, how long it could take them to fill it out, and a HUGE button to click on that would take them directly to the location where they can immediately being the assessment."

I then have conditionals in place that will output a Display Only HTML bit listing what equipment and access the user is to expect at that position.\n\nNow that all works fine, but there is no way for me to label those display only fields in a way I can organize without the label showing up on the form itself. The actual \"Label\" field puts that over the text of the display only box I am outputting. It would be nice to have an internal label field I can use to know which of the 20+ display only fields I am clicking on to adjust/edit without having to open them one by one and guess."

Quoting for equipment with disty integration\n2. Proposals for MSA/MSP service contracts\n3. E-sign for contracts\n4. Assessments (https://www.zomentum.com/sales-assessments) with easy conversion into proposals\n\nPotential ideas for integration include:\n\n* Quoting/proposal integration similar to what you can already to with Quosal/QW/Quoter\n* Synchronize signed agreements/contracts so clients can view in their portal\n* When clients order certain items in the service catalogue it can automatically generate a quote/proposal for them over in Zomentum\n* Approved items in the planner tool could feed into the Zomentum proposal\n* Information/items flagged for review from the initial sales assessment that was conducted in the Zomentum Sales Assessment tool, before the prospect has become a client, will become part of the initial baseline of items for review in the CloudRadial QBR-related features"

My guess would be that since child tickets are hidden in CW, CR can't find the notes to attach.  Is there anything we can do on the Cloudradial side to work around this?"

It provides a cleaner view of what is active vs a record.\n\nDoing the same for Projects would reduce the noise in the screen for the client and make it easier to navigate.\n\nAnother improvement in the Projects space would be to list Project Tickets in the same order as in the Work Plan (CW Manage) once a Project has been selected. |"

Please add an auto-update function, especially with the number of bugs that are found weekly Chrome I would assume some of those exist on the Chromium side occasionally as well."

        "plain_text_body": "Howdy folks,\n\n\nI'm going to start by saying I've inherited our company's Client Portal as a responsibility, and I've been struggling to find my footing on where to start with getting things trimmed up and back on track. The one way I'm specifically stuck is with being able to have an understanding of Who The F### gets What The F###, and How The F### it gets there. (I'm not upset I promise I just think I'm funny)\n\n\nThe main issue for me is that I'm a hands on, visual kinda guy, and at present mapping out an understanding of the content in place and the access different roles provide to that content (let alone the feature sets in place that further obfuscates things) requires cross referencing multiple different menus and locations that are never on screen at the same time. This might not be a problem if setup was well documented and features were implemented with a strong roadmap of their intended use, sure, but I think that Cloud Radial should be able to present a decent summary of a client's environment with the data it has in its clutches. An account manager should be able to look in there and know, at a glance, what access and content gets provisioned to a user for a given client when assigning a specific role. It should also be clear at a glance what content the client has access to, and whether any of the content provisioned to them has been orphaned from broader publishing due to edits locally to their given environment.\n\n\nI'm not just trying to be a backseat designer here, I've been working on something for myself using my extremely rudimentary Excel/Google Sheets skills to accomplish this using exports from the portal (or having to manually create sheets for things that can't be exported such as my page for Feature Sets access). I'd post a screenshot showing what I've put together so far for my own use but apparently this form doesn't allow pictures, so broadly speaking:\n\n\nA single page summary for any given client that shows:\n\n* Feature Set\n* Assigned Home Page\n* Company Groups\n* Content Packages Published (and which Company Group published each)\n* Orphaned/Client Specific Content Packages\n* Access Provided via Feature Set\n* Available Roles\n* Access to the above provided to each role\n\n\nI've got about 40% of the above built myself, but the issue is that this is just a static document and will be out of date the second I or anybody else makes a single change to the portal; its usefulness only extends as far as my understanding what's in place, and I had to manually extract and format a lot of data that Cloud Radial already has access to. And probably much more skilled web developers than I am with nested FILTER formulas in Excel.\n\n\nIf it's possible to add screenshots after the fact in the comments on this post I will to better illustrate what I'm looking for. I sincerely believe CR is a really awesome platform to work from, but as it stands it relies heavily on robust external documentation and tightly controlled standards for it to be managed easily by your average monkey at an MSP (i.e. yours truly). If there's any information I can provide or ways I can elaborate on my request here to make it more clear, please let me know and I'll gladly oblige!\n\n\nPlease save me from myself, I'm very not good at this :)"

        "plain_text_body": "I have reviewed through the ability to add a condition to a question within the Content Service Catalog (https://support.cloudradial.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027708971?input_string=multiple+conditions). Although, I can't seem to find a method to enter multiple conditions on one question.\n\nFor example: I would like to add a content service catalog for updating an Azure AD group. I would like to list one of the questions to only be listed if two other questions are true.\n\nThis would be helpful in collecting as much information as possible on something generic like 'Update Azure AD Group' where the choices for updating the group are different based on specified information. This is especially true if the user(s) submitting requests may not know the specifics of their current group without being prompted for the available options."

        "plain_text_body": "Right now the only way to categorize groups of approvers is either:\n\n- by the approver list, or\n\n- as a default all admins for that company.\n\nWe have many companies that require the ability to auto-approve requests from VIPs who do not actively approve company tickets, but need their own tickets to auto-approve.\n\nThere's been backlash since all email addresses on the approver list get notification emails. This is frustrating for our top VIP, because the only way for their personal ticket to auto-approve is for them to receive notifications for every approval in the entire company. The same happens when we use the default system. All company admins receive the notification email.\n\nI'd recommend a way to utilize both the approver list AND the admins together. If there was a way to activate admin and part-admin auto-approval, while there was an approval list active, then we could have VIPs as part-admins who have their tickets auto-approve. Plus the company approver list would act more as the a Approval Notification Email List. Most of our companies would only want one or two users to receive these emails anyways.\n\nOr even - if there was a VIP box for each user (only visible to Partners obv) that gave an option for their submitted tickets to be auto-approved?\n\nAlso it would work if there was a box that could be checked for each admin user and it would with-hold sending that email?"

Cloudradial does not integrate with RMM because it has it's own audit agent which is fine and makes sense for consistency of information for use with policies. However it seems like an easy lift/win to add the ability to at least pull over network devices from the PSA (that were synced from RMM) so that we can populate network devices under infrastructure without having to buy a 3rd party tool like Auvik or Domotz.\n\nThis is imperative for proper asset reporting for the client. It also ties in with compliance and assessments as well. Right now we have no way to reference a network device that needs to get added to the planner."

These are based on products or services we sell.\n\nOn our products we have a custom field were these groups can be listed for each product.\n\nEach night we have a MS Flow process that scans:\n\n* Active Customers\n\n** Active Agreements\n\n*** Active Products\n\n**** Product Groups\n\nWe then automatically add each contact in ConnectWise to the product groups so we can easily email as needed based on feature updates, downtime, etc.\n\nThe main reason for all of this is to automate other functions based on products and services that we are selling to our customers.\n\n=========================\n\nWe really need to be able to automatically link ConnectWise Groups or Company Types to CloudRadial for this same reason.\n\nSince CR does not have granular partner security (yet) and even it if did sales will not remember to access 10 different systems to trigger processes.\n\nIn CR i can build:\n\n* Issue types for Sophos\n* Request types for Sophos\n* KB Articles for Sophos\n* Learning content for Sophos\n\nI can then tie these all to a \"Sophos\" company group in CR. However I have to manually apply the group to the company in CR. If I can link CR Groups or CW Groups or CW Company Types then this becomes 100% automated.\n\nAs soon as sales adds a product to an agreement the customer will automatically see new content in CR for support, features, help, training, etc.\n\nThis would also achieve peace and harmony in the world, so why not do it?"

In DeskDirector they already looked up all the statuses or other items from the PSA and we just checked off ones to include (or exclude). This is far more reliable. If the status or item name changes a bit in the PSA we now have to remember to go to all the places in CloudRadial where we manually entered this and re-do it.\n\nAnother place this is a pain is when selecting specific Type/Subtype/Item for a ticket. Currently we create a PSA token with a T/S/I name, then we use the token name in the ticket. That takes multiple steps and would not be necessary if we just had a drop-down of Type/Subtype/Item that was pulled right from the PSA. This would result in a more robust system ongoing and less having to make a bunch of tokens, and then keep them updated when changes inevitably happen."

Being able to read data in CR directly from PowerBI (some sort of prebuilt connector, with a live feed and sample dashboards, no need to download/upload data). That will help us make awesome dashboards for internal (MSP) use\n2. Embedded, prebuilt PBI dashboards included within the CloudRadial web app that would be available to show reporting on various metrics (productivity, security, etc) for both Account Management, and end client /Point of Contact purposes."

Because of fair margins, good service and an awesome integrated billing platform.\n\nThe idea would be to use the API for mycommandconsole.com (Pax8's online portal) to integrate the service catalog and new requests in CloudRadial. That way users can replace a request for a new licence and once approved it will automatically trigger a licence increase for that particular 365 subscription in the Pax8 portal. Since Pax8 already has billing integration into several PSA's and into customer O365 tenants this would completely automate the entire 365 purchase & provisioning experience."

That way it doesn't impact legibility but is very obviously formatted in a way that makes its different status apparent.\n\nHopefully another easy win for you folks?

However, technicians forget to add it to the ticket and Manage has no workflow options to automatically do this. Thus, it causes issues not charging for the onboarding and have to remediate manually.\n\nYou could also use this for requesting licensing and other things that have standard products in a PSA.

We default that field to zero, but if they enter anything more than zero we would then unhide the field, \"toner cartridge model number.\" That field doesn't need to be visible if they don't need any black cartridges (i.e., just colour ones).\n\nThis is multiplied by 3 then because if the printer is a colour printer, we unhide quantity requests for magenta, cyan, and yellow cartridges. And now we're doubling up on all the fields by having separate \"model number\" fields show up. The form gets a lot more messy.\n\nCurrently we can't even use the numbered question for a conditional statement; it doesn't even show up as I'm guessing conditional statements can only apply to multi-selection, etc. questions. |"

For instance, a section where personnel from the client side can be added to represent that they are approved \"Buyers\" or \"Approvers\" within the company. We could then use this section to request authorizations on software requests from the client's employees to route through them directly to our account managers to get a quote turned around. We also would like to have an IT GOAT account team section published for our clients. It could entail the contact information for the Account Manager, the contact information for the Technical Escalation Manager, etc. The more customizable the better as each MSP is different but the idea is simple. Have fields where the client can add and remove their own employees to and then have fields that IT GOAT can publish static information to. All of these fields then can be used to tag for requests making the communication streamlined even more which would result in fewer back and forth between client and MSP. |"

In the event that an endpoint requires \"re-activation\", this needs to be done by a support request to CloudRadial support.\n\n\nIn addition, there is no method within CloudRadial for the tech who is re-activating the endpoint to even know that the endpoint has been blocked, which means extra time spent troubleshooting why an agent won't show up in the dashboard."

This should be used to drive our billing and certainly ScoutDNS uses it to drive the billing to us.\n\n\nHello Rene,\n\nOne of the challenges we have had with the Cloud Radial and ScoutDNS partnership has been getting billing info accurate and on time. To address this, we added an API endpoint that calculates seats for you once you have entered the invoice date. The idea is that Todd or his team would be able to get this info based on the ScoutDNS invoice date so that our invoices are always in sync and error free.\n\nPlease see this API endpoint here and let me know if you have any questions. You can ignore the cost parts of the request as you are only looking for seat totals based off the invoice date entered. This is our operator API, so the key is unique for each account.\n\nScoutDNS | 1.0.5 | ScoutDNS | SwaggerHub (https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.swaggerhub.com%2Fapis%2FScoutDNS%2FScoutDNS%2F1.0.5%23%2FUsage%252FBilling%2FgetUsageBillingStats&data=05%7C02%7Crene.gourley%40cloudradial.com%7C591da8cdb14a407b94e708dca4ee24d9%7C67db25cc2f9f47aba5fc29b374107a16%7C0%7C0%7C638566589961965790%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wrhP34%2BG%2Bu80drql%2BssPdBdsOD2uVza%2B%2FgSXxRbR0fw%3D&reserved=0)  |"

As part of their new marketplace, they are implementing a standard protocol that all their vendors must support.\n(see https://devx.pax8.com/docs/how-to-use-provisioning-endpoints and https://devx.pax8.com/docs/how-to-use-usage-endpoints) we may as well do this as part of the work to get Chat, DNS and Storefront into the product.\n\nThe project entails:\n\n1. Figuring out exactly what their docs mean, because I didn't find it that clear.\n2. Creating new tables or columns to track distributors' information because currently we use our IDs, whereas now we will need to know Pax8 IDs for partners and subscriptions.\n3. Standing up a new webhook to receive notifications of provisioning events.\n4. New tables to track provisioning events because the provisioning is split over multiple webhooks.\n5. Something to do with defining products and webhooks.\n6. Revision of the usage notification because the direction of conversation is reversed.\n\nI expect it will take about three to five developer months to execute.\n\n1.\n\n |"

With the direct interaction it has with ConnectWise's API and some built in ticketing settings now, with a bit of tweaking it could be a simplistic Support Desk tool for techs who do not use the more complicated systems in ConnectWise.\n\nHere are my thoughts on things CloudRadial lacks that could push it into a viable alternative for ticket handling in a ConnectWise based MSP.\n\n- The ability to assign companies and Clients to user who are employees of the partner\n\n* The ability to set permissions for Partner users to see and update all tickets in a certain set of boards/filters in their own portal rather than having to open up each client and browse users to see tickets.\n* With the Ability to see tickets from the MSP portal the ability to send out schedules a la a TimeZest type system or even just TimeZest integration.\n* The ability for a Client who has opened a ticket via the CloudRadial portal to request to schedule a 15 or 30 minute using a group of assigned technicians ConnectWise Calendar availability as options to choose.\n\nThese are just some of the basics but with my Company rolling out more and more clients to CloudRadial, it's taking a bit longer and longer as time goes on for our Techs to have to keep bouncing around with Keeping CloudRadial open and ConnectWise for Scheduling."

Under this section, there would be a number of entries that follow a structured format. IE, ISP Name, Type of Connection, Support Contact Number, Account Number, File Upload for a Letter of Agency, Upload Speed, Download Speed, Contract Expiration Date, etc, etc.\n\nSome of these categories of structured content may be just for internal MSP access. Others may be available to clients based on their users' permissions/groups.\n\n\nPLEASE OH PLEASE CONSIDER THIS!!!!! Even something basic would probably be a TON better than what ITGlue is currently doing."

It'd be nice to be able to set a default (using the ! formatting) just like the other question types.\n\n\nExample: Something like \"Is this issue an emergency?\"\n\nQuestion type: Priority (PSA)\n\nChoices: Medium|No!, Critical|Yes\n\nor alternatively, Medium!|No, Critical!|Yes\n\nAs long as there is some way to get the form to respect the \"!\" formatting, that'd allow us to better route tickets while presenting the user with customized questoins that don't necessarily align with internal PSA field naming conventions."

We are successfully using filters based on office location to only sync users assigned to that location to each org to keep contacts up to date.\n\nWhen those users are mapped in Gradient via CR, the count for the entire org comes over, not just the users filtered. This prevents us from using this for billing which it is so close to being able to do.\n\nIf a checkbox could be created in the Gradient integration that would \"sync only filtered users\" that would suffice and allow us to use the Gradient integration for management organizations."

Specifically, our company admins who can see all tickets for a customer are having a hard time because of the limitations of the support tickets page. They would like the following capabilities:\n\n\n* customize the view (choose which columns are visible, and more) on the support tickets page\n\n** ability to display subtype/item columns (Connectwise PSA)\n** ability to display \"site\" column\n** ability to filter support tickets based on the columns (in our case, the view can be cluttered up with \"NOC\" category tickets, which are generally just system-generated alerts. If the customer could click the \"category\" column and filter out a certain category, this would be a huge boost to usability)\n\n* ability to save searches would also be a help\n* dropdowns for the search criteria rather than having to manually type in each term (priority, status, category, etc)\n* search within ticket text, not just subject"
